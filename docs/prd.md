### Enhancement Scope Definition

**Enhancement Type**: ✅ **Bug Fix and Stability Improvements**

**Enhancement Description**:
Comprehensive Quality Assurance and Bug Fixing Initiative targeting systematic testing, bug identification, and stabilization across all 11 microservices of the production Zuno Marketplace API system.

**Impact Assessment**: ✅ **Significant Impact** (substantial existing code testing and potential bug fixes required)

### Goals and Background Context

**Enhanced Goals (Measurable)**:
• Achieve minimum 85% test coverage across all 11 microservices with comprehensive regression test suite
• Identify and fix all Critical/High severity bugs in user flows: SIWE auth (0 auth failures), minting (100% transaction success), indexing (0 data loss)
• Establish performance baselines and optimize services exceeding 95th percentile response time SLAs
• Document minimum 95% of discovered bugs with root cause analysis and fix tracking
• Implement automated QA pipeline with 0 false positives in critical path monitoring

**Enhanced Background Context**:
The Zuno Marketplace API serves a production NFT marketplace with real user transactions and financial implications. While the system achieved 100% production readiness score, this focused on feature completeness and infrastructure stability. **Critical Gap**: Systematic edge case testing and stress testing under production load conditions have not been performed. This initiative ensures the system can handle unexpected user behaviors, high-load scenarios, and complex transaction edge cases that could result in financial losses or user trust issues.

## Requirements (REVISED - Phased Conservative Approach)

### Functional Requirements (Phase-Based)

**FR1**: The QA initiative shall establish comprehensive test coverage using a 4-phase approach: Phase 1 (Critical paths: 95% coverage for auth-service), Phase 2 (Financial flows: 95% coverage for orchestrator-service, minting), Phase 3 (Data integrity: 95% coverage for indexer-service, catalog-service), Phase 4 (Integration: 60-70% coverage for remaining services).

**FR2**: The testing system shall validate critical user flows with realistic success criteria: SIWE authentication (<0.1% failure rate), NFT minting (>99% success rate under normal load), blockchain event indexing (>99.9% data consistency), using testnet-only blockchain connections (Sepolia, Mumbai, BSC Testnet).

**FR3**: The bug tracking system shall classify discovered issues into: Simple bugs (fix within initiative), Architectural bugs (document as separate epic), Breaking changes (require stakeholder approval), with mandatory rollback plans for all fixes.

**FR4**: The QA process shall implement phased regression testing: Individual service testing with mocked dependencies (Phases 1-3), full integration testing with separate RabbitMQ test instance (Phase 4), automated regression suite execution within 20 minutes per phase.

**FR5**: The performance validation system shall establish baseline metrics for critical paths only, identifying optimization opportunities that don't require architectural changes, with focus on auth response times (<200ms) and minting transaction processing (<5 seconds).

### Non-Functional Requirements (Cost-Effective & Safe)

**NFR1**: All testing activities must use synthetic data generation (NO production snapshots for GDPR compliance), testnet-only blockchain connections, and Docker Compose environments with dedicated test clusters limited to 20% of production resource allocation.

**NFR2**: The QA infrastructure budget shall not exceed $2000-3000/month with testnet gas fee budget capped at $500, using mocked external APIs (IPFS/Pinata, RPC nodes) to prevent cost explosion.

**NFR3**: Bug fix implementations must maintain backward compatibility and use feature flags for significant changes, with database migrations required to be reversible and documented rollback procedures.

**NFR4**: Each phase must complete within 2-week timeframes with clear success criteria: Phase 1 (Auth validated), Phase 2 (Financial integrity verified), Phase 3 (Data consistency confirmed), Phase 4 (Integration tested).

**NFR5**: Circuit breaker configurations remain unchanged during testing, with optional "test mode" flag implementation to bypass circuit breakers if needed, documenting any circuit breaker trips during QA activities.

### Compatibility Requirements (Conservative Approach)

**CR1**: API Compatibility - All bug fixes must maintain existing GraphQL schema and gRPC contracts, with architectural changes deferred to separate post-QA epics requiring stakeholder approval.

**CR2**: Database Schema Compatibility - Testing must preserve all existing schema structures, with synthetic data matching production patterns without exposing sensitive information.

**CR3**: Event-Driven Compatibility - Integration testing uses separate RabbitMQ test instance to prevent production event contamination, with event replay scenarios tested in isolation.

**CR4**: Infrastructure Compatibility - Phased testing approach works within existing Docker/Kubernetes constraints, with production configurations unchanged during QA activities.

## Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

### Existing Technology Stack
Based on architecture documentation analysis:

**Languages**: Go 1.24.5 (latest stable, all 11 microservices)
**Frameworks**: gRPC 1.75.0 (inter-service), GraphQL/gqlgen 0.17.78 (gateway)
**Database**: PostgreSQL 14+ (multi-schema), MongoDB 6.0+ (events/metadata), Redis 7.0+ (cache/sessions)
**Infrastructure**: Docker Compose (test), Kubernetes/Tilt (production), RabbitMQ 3.12+ (events)
**External Dependencies**: IPFS/Pinata (media), Ethereum/Polygon/BSC RPCs (blockchain)

**QA-Specific Constraints**: Testnet configurations exist for all chains, existing test framework uses testcontainers, circuit breakers implemented via shared/resilience package.

### Integration Approach (Phased Strategy)

**Database Integration Strategy**:
- Phases 1-3: Synthetic data generation matching production schemas
- Phase 4: Controlled integration testing with test database clusters
- All migrations reversible with documented rollback procedures

**API Integration Strategy**:
- Mock external APIs during intensive testing (IPFS/Pinata, RPC nodes)
- Maintain existing GraphQL/gRPC contracts without modification
- Test API compatibility with existing frontend applications using contract testing

**Frontend Integration Strategy**:
- No frontend changes during QA initiative
- Regression testing validates existing API contracts remain intact
- Performance impact testing ensures response time SLAs maintained

**Testing Integration Strategy**:
- Phase 1-3: Individual service testing with mocked dependencies
- Phase 4: Full integration testing with separate test infrastructure
- Existing testcontainers framework extended for comprehensive service testing

### Code Organization and Standards

**File Structure Approach**:
Follow existing patterns: `services/{service}/test/` for service-specific tests, `test/e2e/` for integration tests, new `test/qa/` directory for QA-specific test suites and documentation.

**Naming Conventions**:
Maintain existing Go conventions, test files follow `*_qa_test.go` pattern, bug tracking follows `BUG-{service}-{number}` format (e.g., `BUG-AUTH-001`).

**Coding Standards**:
All QA code follows existing golangci-lint rules, test coverage reporting integrated with existing CI/CD, documentation uses existing zerolog structured logging patterns.

**Documentation Standards**:
Bug reports stored in `docs/qa/bugs/`, test plans in `docs/qa/plans/`, phase reports in `docs/qa/phases/`, following existing markdown standards with BMAD-compatible formatting.

### Deployment and Operations

**Build Process Integration**:
QA testing integrated into existing Makefile targets, new `make qa-phase-{n}` commands, Docker Compose configurations for isolated test environments, no modifications to production build process.

**Deployment Strategy**:
Phased rollout of bug fixes using existing deployment pipeline, feature flags for significant changes, staging environment validation before production deployment, rollback procedures documented per phase.

**Monitoring and Logging**:
Existing Prometheus metrics extended with QA-specific metrics, structured logging with zerolog for all test activities, Sentry integration for QA environment error tracking, test execution metrics tracked separately from production.

**Configuration Management**:
Separate `.env.qa` files for test environments, testnet-only blockchain configurations, synthetic data generation parameters, resource limits for test infrastructure clearly defined.

### Risk Assessment and Mitigation (Updated with Conservative Approach)

**Technical Risks**:
Service testing may reveal race conditions requiring architectural changes (MITIGATION: Document as separate epics), load testing could impact external service quotas (MITIGATION: Mock all external APIs), test environment drift from production (MITIGATION: Docker Compose parity testing).

**Integration Risks**:
Cross-service dependencies may create cascade test failures (MITIGATION: Phased approach with service isolation), event-driven architecture timing issues (MITIGATION: Separate RabbitMQ test instance), circuit breaker interactions during testing (MITIGATION: Optional test mode bypass).

**Deployment Risks**:
Bug fixes may introduce regressions (MITIGATION: Comprehensive regression testing per phase), database migration failures (MITIGATION: Reversible migrations only), production impact from testing activities (MITIGATION: Complete infrastructure isolation).

**Mitigation Strategies**:
$3000 monthly infrastructure budget with cost monitoring, $500 testnet gas fee cap with automated cutoff, synthetic data generation for GDPR compliance, architectural changes deferred to post-QA roadmap, stakeholder approval required for breaking changes.

## Implementation Timeline and Dependencies

### Phase Dependencies and Risk Mitigation

**Phase 1 → Phase 2 Dependency**: Authentication testing must validate secure session management before proceeding to financial transaction testing. If authentication vulnerabilities are discovered, Phase 2 is blocked until fixes are implemented and validated.

**Phase 2 → Phase 3 Dependency**: Financial transaction integrity must be confirmed before testing data indexing, as indexing accuracy depends on reliable transaction data. Critical financial bugs trigger initiative pause for architectural review.

**Phase 3 → Phase 4 Dependency**: Data consistency and indexing accuracy must be validated before full system integration testing. Integration testing requires stable data foundation to produce meaningful results.

**Critical Path Risk**: If any phase discovers architectural issues requiring major changes, subsequent phases are paused pending stakeholder review and separate epic creation for architectural fixes.
