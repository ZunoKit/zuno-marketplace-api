# Implementation Timeline and Dependencies

### Phase Dependencies and Risk Mitigation

**Phase 1 → Phase 2 Dependency**: Authentication testing must validate secure session management before proceeding to financial transaction testing. If authentication vulnerabilities are discovered, Phase 2 is blocked until fixes are implemented and validated.

**Phase 2 → Phase 3 Dependency**: Financial transaction integrity must be confirmed before testing data indexing, as indexing accuracy depends on reliable transaction data. Critical financial bugs trigger initiative pause for architectural review.

**Phase 3 → Phase 4 Dependency**: Data consistency and indexing accuracy must be validated before full system integration testing. Integration testing requires stable data foundation to produce meaningful results.

**Critical Path Risk**: If any phase discovers architectural issues requiring major changes, subsequent phases are paused pending stakeholder review and separate epic creation for architectural fixes.

### Resource Allocation and Budget Control

**Infrastructure Costs (Per Phase)**:
- Phase 1: $500/month (lightweight synthetic data testing)
- Phase 2: $800/month (testnet blockchain connections)
- Phase 3: $1000/month (database intensive testing)
- Phase 4: $1200/month (full integration testing)
- **Total Budget**: $3500 for 8-week initiative (within $3000/month average)

**Testnet Gas Fee Allocation**:
- Phase 1: $50 (minimal blockchain interaction)
- Phase 2: $300 (intensive minting and transaction testing)
- Phase 3: $100 (indexing validation)
- Phase 4: $50 (integration validation)
- **Total Gas Budget**: $500 (within approved limit)

**Team Resource Requirements**:
- 1 Senior QA Engineer (full-time, 8 weeks)
- 1 DevOps Engineer (25% allocation for infrastructure)
- 1 Backend Developer (on-call for bug fixes)
- 1 Product Manager (oversight and stakeholder communication)
