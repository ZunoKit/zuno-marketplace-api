# Epic 3: Data Integrity and Indexing Validation (Weeks 5-6)

**Epic Goal**: Ensure 95% test coverage for blockchain event indexing and catalog data consistency, validating that all blockchain events are captured accurately and NFT marketplace data remains synchronized.

**Integration Requirements**: Controlled testing of indexer-service and catalog-service with synthetic blockchain event data and production-pattern database snapshots.

### Story 3.1: Blockchain Event Indexing Accuracy

As a QA Engineer,
I want to validate blockchain event indexing accuracy across all supported chains,
so that marketplace data remains synchronized with blockchain state.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Event indexing tested for Ethereum, Polygon, and BSC testnets
2. Event parsing and database storage accuracy validated
3. Missing event detection and recovery mechanisms tested
4. Indexing performance under high event volume verified
5. Event deduplication and idempotency confirmed

**Integration Verification:**
- **IV1**: Production indexing continues without interruption
- **IV2**: Test event data isolated from production blockchain monitoring
- **IV3**: Indexing service performance remains within SLA thresholds

### Story 3.2: Chain Reorganization Handling

As a QA Engineer,
I want to test blockchain reorganization detection and handling,
so that marketplace data accurately reflects the canonical blockchain state.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Chain reorganization simulation and detection tested
2. Event rollback and re-indexing procedures validated
3. Data consistency maintained during reorganization events
4. User-facing data updates during chain reorgs tested
5. Performance impact of reorganization handling measured

**Integration Verification:**
- **IV1**: Production chain reorganization handling remains functional
- **IV2**: Reorganization test scenarios don't affect production indexing
- **IV3**: Database rollback procedures tested without production impact

### Story 3.3: NFT Catalog Data Consistency

As a QA Engineer,
I want to validate NFT catalog data consistency and marketplace statistics,
so that users see accurate collection and NFT information.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. NFT metadata synchronization between indexer and catalog tested
2. Collection statistics calculation accuracy validated
3. Cross-service data consistency between catalog and other services verified
4. Cache invalidation and data refresh mechanisms tested
5. Performance of catalog queries under load measured

**Integration Verification:**
- **IV1**: Production catalog data remains accurate during testing
- **IV2**: Cache systems continue to function optimally
- **IV3**: Catalog service performance maintained within acceptable limits

### Story 3.4: Data Recovery and Backup Procedures

As a QA Engineer,
I want to test data recovery and backup procedures for critical marketplace data,
so that system can recover from data corruption or loss scenarios.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Database backup and restore procedures validated
2. Event replay capabilities from blockchain checkpoints tested
3. Data corruption detection and recovery mechanisms verified
4. Cross-service data synchronization recovery tested
5. Recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO) validated

**Integration Verification:**
- **IV1**: Production backup procedures remain operational
- **IV2**: Recovery testing uses isolated environments only
- **IV3**: Data recovery procedures preserve production system integrity
