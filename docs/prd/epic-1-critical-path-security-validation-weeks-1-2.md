# Epic 1: Critical Path Security Validation (Weeks 1-2)

**Epic Goal**: Establish 95% test coverage for authentication and session management flows using synthetic data and testnet configurations, ensuring zero security vulnerabilities in user identity and access systems.

**Integration Requirements**: Isolated testing of auth-service and user-service with mocked dependencies, synthetic user data generation, testnet-only SIWE configurations.

### Story 1.1: Authentication Flow Test Framework Setup

As a QA Engineer,
I want to establish comprehensive test framework for SIWE authentication flows,
so that all authentication edge cases can be systematically validated without production impact.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Test environment configured with Sepolia testnet for SIWE authentication
2. Synthetic user data generator creates realistic test accounts without PII
3. Mock wallet connections simulate MetaMask/WalletConnect without real wallet requirements
4. Test framework covers happy path, error cases, and edge case scenarios
5. Automated test execution completes in under 10 minutes

**Integration Verification:**
- **IV1**: Existing production authentication flow remains functional during parallel test execution
- **IV2**: Test framework isolation verified - no test data appears in production databases
- **IV3**: Performance impact measurement shows <5% resource usage increase during testing

### Story 1.2: Session Management and Token Rotation Testing

As a QA Engineer,
I want to validate session management and refresh token rotation under various scenarios,
so that user sessions remain secure and stable under all conditions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Test scenarios cover concurrent sessions, session expiration, and token rotation edge cases
2. Device fingerprinting functionality validated with synthetic device data
3. Session blacklist functionality tested with Redis mock
4. Race condition testing for simultaneous token refresh requests
5. Session persistence testing across service restarts

**Integration Verification:**
- **IV1**: Existing user sessions remain unaffected during session testing
- **IV2**: Redis cache integrity maintained - test keys use separate namespace
- **IV3**: Token rotation timing verified to match production behavior patterns

### Story 1.3: Authentication Security Edge Cases

As a Security-focused QA Engineer,
I want to test authentication system against attack vectors and edge cases,
so that the system maintains security under adversarial conditions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Replay attack prevention validated with duplicate signature testing
2. Nonce expiration and collision handling tested
3. Invalid signature and malformed request handling verified
4. Rate limiting effectiveness tested with simulated attack patterns
5. Authentication bypass attempts logged and blocked

**Integration Verification:**
- **IV1**: Production rate limiting thresholds remain unchanged and effective
- **IV2**: Security monitoring systems capture test attack patterns appropriately
- **IV3**: Authentication service performance remains stable under attack simulation

### Story 1.4: User Service Integration and Profile Management

As a QA Engineer,
I want to validate user profile management and cross-service communication,
so that user data integrity is maintained across auth and user services.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. User profile creation and updates tested with synthetic data
2. Cross-service communication between auth-service and user-service validated
3. User data consistency verified across authentication and profile operations
4. gRPC connection testing between services under load
5. Error handling for service unavailability scenarios

**Integration Verification:**
- **IV1**: Existing user profiles remain intact and accessible during testing
- **IV2**: gRPC circuit breakers function correctly during simulated service failures
- **IV3**: User service performance metrics remain within acceptable thresholds
