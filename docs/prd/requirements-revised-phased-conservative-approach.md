# Requirements (REVISED - Phased Conservative Approach)

### Functional Requirements (Phase-Based)

**FR1**: The QA initiative shall establish comprehensive test coverage using a 4-phase approach: Phase 1 (Critical paths: 95% coverage for auth-service), Phase 2 (Financial flows: 95% coverage for orchestrator-service, minting), Phase 3 (Data integrity: 95% coverage for indexer-service, catalog-service), Phase 4 (Integration: 60-70% coverage for remaining services).

**FR2**: The testing system shall validate critical user flows with realistic success criteria: SIWE authentication (<0.1% failure rate), NFT minting (>99% success rate under normal load), blockchain event indexing (>99.9% data consistency), using testnet-only blockchain connections (Sepolia, Mumbai, BSC Testnet).

**FR3**: The bug tracking system shall classify discovered issues into: Simple bugs (fix within initiative), Architectural bugs (document as separate epic), Breaking changes (require stakeholder approval), with mandatory rollback plans for all fixes.

**FR4**: The QA process shall implement phased regression testing: Individual service testing with mocked dependencies (Phases 1-3), full integration testing with separate RabbitMQ test instance (Phase 4), automated regression suite execution within 20 minutes per phase.

**FR5**: The performance validation system shall establish baseline metrics for critical paths only, identifying optimization opportunities that don't require architectural changes, with focus on auth response times (<200ms) and minting transaction processing (<5 seconds).

### Non-Functional Requirements (Cost-Effective & Safe)

**NFR1**: All testing activities must use synthetic data generation (NO production snapshots for GDPR compliance), testnet-only blockchain connections, and Docker Compose environments with dedicated test clusters limited to 20% of production resource allocation.

**NFR2**: The QA infrastructure budget shall not exceed $2000-3000/month with testnet gas fee budget capped at $500, using mocked external APIs (IPFS/Pinata, RPC nodes) to prevent cost explosion.

**NFR3**: Bug fix implementations must maintain backward compatibility and use feature flags for significant changes, with database migrations required to be reversible and documented rollback procedures.

**NFR4**: Each phase must complete within 2-week timeframes with clear success criteria: Phase 1 (Auth validated), Phase 2 (Financial integrity verified), Phase 3 (Data consistency confirmed), Phase 4 (Integration tested).

**NFR5**: Circuit breaker configurations remain unchanged during testing, with optional "test mode" flag implementation to bypass circuit breakers if needed, documenting any circuit breaker trips during QA activities.

### Compatibility Requirements (Conservative Approach)

**CR1**: API Compatibility - All bug fixes must maintain existing GraphQL schema and gRPC contracts, with architectural changes deferred to separate post-QA epics requiring stakeholder approval.

**CR2**: Database Schema Compatibility - Testing must preserve all existing schema structures, with synthetic data matching production patterns without exposing sensitive information.

**CR3**: Event-Driven Compatibility - Integration testing uses separate RabbitMQ test instance to prevent production event contamination, with event replay scenarios tested in isolation.

**CR4**: Infrastructure Compatibility - Phased testing approach works within existing Docker/Kubernetes constraints, with production configurations unchanged during QA activities.
