# Epic 2: Financial Flow Integrity Validation (Weeks 3-4)

**Epic Goal**: Achieve 95% test coverage for transaction orchestration and minting flows using testnet-only blockchain connections, ensuring financial transaction integrity and preventing monetary losses.

**Integration Requirements**: Isolated testing of orchestrator-service with mocked blockchain RPCs, synthetic collection and NFT data, comprehensive transaction flow validation.

### Story 2.1: Transaction Intent System Testing

As a QA Engineer,
I want to validate the transaction intent orchestration system end-to-end,
so that all user-initiated transactions are properly managed and tracked.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Intent creation, tracking, and completion lifecycle tested comprehensively
2. Transaction intent persistence validated across service restarts
3. Intent timeout and expiration handling verified
4. Multiple concurrent intent processing tested
5. Intent status synchronization across services validated

**Integration Verification:**
- **IV1**: Existing transaction intents in production remain unaffected
- **IV2**: Orchestrator service maintains performance under test load
- **IV3**: Intent tracking database integrity preserved during testing

### Story 2.2: Collection Creation Flow Testing

As a QA Engineer,
I want to comprehensively test NFT collection creation workflows,
so that users can reliably create collections without transaction failures.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Collection metadata validation and IPFS integration tested with mocked services
2. Smart contract deployment simulation on testnet networks
3. Collection preparation and contract deployment coordination validated
4. Error handling for failed contract deployments tested
5. Collection indexing and catalog integration verified

**Integration Verification:**
- **IV1**: Production collection creation remains functional during testing
- **IV2**: IPFS/Pinata API rate limits respected during mock testing
- **IV3**: Media service integration points validated without real media uploads

### Story 2.3: NFT Minting Transaction Testing

As a QA Engineer,
I want to validate NFT minting transaction flows under various conditions,
so that minting operations achieve >99% success rate under normal load.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Minting transaction creation and broadcast tested on testnet
2. Gas fee estimation and transaction optimization validated
3. Failed transaction handling and retry logic tested
4. Batch minting scenarios tested for efficiency
5. Minting event processing and confirmation tracked

**Integration Verification:**
- **IV1**: Production minting operations continue uninterrupted
- **IV2**: Testnet gas fee budget ($500 cap) monitored and respected
- **IV3**: Blockchain RPC rate limiting tested without impacting production quotas

### Story 2.4: Financial Transaction Error Handling

As a QA Engineer,
I want to test all financial transaction error scenarios and recovery mechanisms,
so that users never lose funds due to system failures.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Network failure during transaction broadcast handling tested
2. Insufficient gas fee scenarios and user notification verified
3. Transaction stuck in mempool handling and user communication tested
4. Blockchain reorganization impact on pending transactions validated
5. Fund recovery and transaction retry mechanisms verified

**Integration Verification:**
- **IV1**: Production error handling remains robust during parallel testing
- **IV2**: User notification systems function correctly for test scenarios
- **IV3**: Transaction recovery mechanisms preserve data integrity
