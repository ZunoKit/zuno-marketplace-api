# Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

### Existing Technology Stack
Based on architecture documentation analysis:

**Languages**: Go 1.24.5 (latest stable, all 11 microservices)
**Frameworks**: gRPC 1.75.0 (inter-service), GraphQL/gqlgen 0.17.78 (gateway)
**Database**: PostgreSQL 14+ (multi-schema), MongoDB 6.0+ (events/metadata), Redis 7.0+ (cache/sessions)
**Infrastructure**: Docker Compose (test), Kubernetes/Tilt (production), RabbitMQ 3.12+ (events)
**External Dependencies**: IPFS/Pinata (media), Ethereum/Polygon/BSC RPCs (blockchain)

**QA-Specific Constraints**: Testnet configurations exist for all chains, existing test framework uses testcontainers, circuit breakers implemented via shared/resilience package.

### Integration Approach (Phased Strategy)

**Database Integration Strategy**:
- Phases 1-3: Synthetic data generation matching production schemas
- Phase 4: Controlled integration testing with test database clusters
- All migrations reversible with documented rollback procedures

**API Integration Strategy**:
- Mock external APIs during intensive testing (IPFS/Pinata, RPC nodes)
- Maintain existing GraphQL/gRPC contracts without modification
- Test API compatibility with existing frontend applications using contract testing

**Frontend Integration Strategy**:
- No frontend changes during QA initiative
- Regression testing validates existing API contracts remain intact
- Performance impact testing ensures response time SLAs maintained

**Testing Integration Strategy**:
- Phase 1-3: Individual service testing with mocked dependencies
- Phase 4: Full integration testing with separate test infrastructure
- Existing testcontainers framework extended for comprehensive service testing

### Code Organization and Standards

**File Structure Approach**:
Follow existing patterns: `services/{service}/test/` for service-specific tests, `test/e2e/` for integration tests, new `test/qa/` directory for QA-specific test suites and documentation.

**Naming Conventions**:
Maintain existing Go conventions, test files follow `*_qa_test.go` pattern, bug tracking follows `BUG-{service}-{number}` format (e.g., `BUG-AUTH-001`).

**Coding Standards**:
All QA code follows existing golangci-lint rules, test coverage reporting integrated with existing CI/CD, documentation uses existing zerolog structured logging patterns.

**Documentation Standards**:
Bug reports stored in `docs/qa/bugs/`, test plans in `docs/qa/plans/`, phase reports in `docs/qa/phases/`, following existing markdown standards with BMAD-compatible formatting.

### Deployment and Operations

**Build Process Integration**:
QA testing integrated into existing Makefile targets, new `make qa-phase-{n}` commands, Docker Compose configurations for isolated test environments, no modifications to production build process.

**Deployment Strategy**:
Phased rollout of bug fixes using existing deployment pipeline, feature flags for significant changes, staging environment validation before production deployment, rollback procedures documented per phase.

**Monitoring and Logging**:
Existing Prometheus metrics extended with QA-specific metrics, structured logging with zerolog for all test activities, Sentry integration for QA environment error tracking, test execution metrics tracked separately from production.

**Configuration Management**:
Separate `.env.qa` files for test environments, testnet-only blockchain configurations, synthetic data generation parameters, resource limits for test infrastructure clearly defined.

### Risk Assessment and Mitigation (Updated with Conservative Approach)

**Technical Risks**:
Service testing may reveal race conditions requiring architectural changes (MITIGATION: Document as separate epics), load testing could impact external service quotas (MITIGATION: Mock all external APIs), test environment drift from production (MITIGATION: Docker Compose parity testing).

**Integration Risks**:
Cross-service dependencies may create cascade test failures (MITIGATION: Phased approach with service isolation), event-driven architecture timing issues (MITIGATION: Separate RabbitMQ test instance), circuit breaker interactions during testing (MITIGATION: Optional test mode bypass).

**Deployment Risks**:
Bug fixes may introduce regressions (MITIGATION: Comprehensive regression testing per phase), database migration failures (MITIGATION: Reversible migrations only), production impact from testing activities (MITIGATION: Complete infrastructure isolation).

**Mitigation Strategies**:
$3000 monthly infrastructure budget with cost monitoring, $500 testnet gas fee cap with automated cutoff, synthetic data generation for GDPR compliance, architectural changes deferred to post-QA roadmap, stakeholder approval required for breaking changes.
