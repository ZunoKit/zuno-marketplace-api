# Appendix - Useful Commands and Scripts

### Frequently Used Commands

```bash
# Development
tilt up                    # Start all services (Kubernetes)
docker compose up -d       # Start all services (Docker)
make generate-proto        # Regenerate protobuf code

# Building
cd infra/development/build && ./auth-build.bat  # Windows build scripts
go build -o build/service-name ./services/service-name/cmd

# Testing
go test ./...              # Run all tests
golangci-lint run ./...    # Run linter

# Database
# Migrations are in services/{service}/db/up.sql
# Auto-loaded via docker-entrypoint-initdb.d
```

### Debugging and Troubleshooting

- **Logs**: Each service logs to stdout (captured by Docker/Kubernetes)
- **Metrics**: Check `http://localhost:8081/metrics` for Prometheus metrics
- **Health**: Check `http://localhost:8081/health` for service health
- **Debug Mode**: Set appropriate log levels in environment variables
- **gRPC**: Use tools like `grpcui` for gRPC service debugging

### Environment Configuration

Critical production settings:
```env
# Security
JWT_SECRET=<minimum-256-bit>
REFRESH_SECRET=<minimum-256-bit>
TLS_ENABLED=true

# Performance
MAX_QUERY_COMPLEXITY=1000
MAX_QUERY_DEPTH=10
RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED=true

# Monitoring
PROMETHEUS_ENABLED=true
SENTRY_DSN=<your-sentry-dsn>
```
