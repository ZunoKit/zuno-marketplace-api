# Technical Debt and Known Issues

### Production Strengths (No Critical Technical Debt)

1. **Security**: Complete mTLS implementation, token rotation, rate limiting
2. **Reliability**: Circuit breakers integrated in all gRPC clients
3. **Performance**: Query complexity limits, optimized indexes, connection pooling
4. **Observability**: Comprehensive logging, metrics, distributed tracing
5. **Testing**: Integration tests with testcontainers, E2E test framework

### Minor Areas for Enhancement (Post-v1.0.0)

1. **Documentation**: Could benefit from API documentation generation
2. **Monitoring**: Additional business metrics for marketplace analytics
3. **Performance**: Potential for GraphQL query optimization caching
4. **Deployment**: Helm charts for production Kubernetes deployment

### Architectural Decisions and Constraints

- **Single Go Module**: Simplifies dependency management but requires careful package design
- **PostgreSQL Multi-Schema**: Each service owns its schema, no cross-service queries
- **Intent-Based Transactions**: Complex but provides excellent UX for blockchain interactions
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: RabbitMQ for loose coupling between services
